## ***User story***
#### As a job recruiter, I am interested in giving Ifeanyi an interview but I have to look at his portfolio first. I want to see his creative style and process. I hope to find some interactive features in his portfolio.
#### Ifeanyi just started working at our company, he asked me to look at his portfolio to make sure everything was up to date and didn't need fixing. As a senior engineer, I will be looking at things like screen compatibility and making sure his links are working.
