    <h1>Project 1</h1>
    <p>My first porject will as a Software engineer was to create  a simply game to play. I chose the game Tic-Tac-Toe becsue it was somthing my sister and I used to play all the time. It is a simple game but has elements that require you to plan ahead and bring out a competitive nature in you. Below you will find the link to my priject one Tic-Tac-Toe game, enjoy. (i might add or removes somthings from this description of my first project).</p>
